## SFT ( Smart Fish Tank ) Embedded Aquatics üêü

The general population doesn‚Äôt have time to take care of a pet, let alone an aquatic one. This is the problem that our ‚ÄòSmart Fish Tank‚Äô embedded project hopes to tackle. The hope is to create a stress-free environment around aquatic pet culture using automation processes.

Our project will use Firebase‚Ñ¢Ô∏è to host sensor data and control the smart fish tank:
- ESP32 to be used in conjunction with Water Quality Monitor
- ESP32 to be used in conjunction with Temperature Sensor
- ESP32-CAM
- ESP32 with stepper motor control the 3D printed feeder
-	ESP32 with Neo Pixels

The ESP32 is programmed using the Arduino IDE with C/C++.
